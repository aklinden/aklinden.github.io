# My GitHub Pages Site

Welcome to my personal website, hosted with **GitHub Pages**.

This site is currently a work in progress. I'm using this repository to experiment with GitHub Pages and will eventually use it to showcase:
- Documentation for projects
- Useful scripts and tools
- Technical blogs or notes
- Links to other repositories

## What's Here Now

Just a basic placeholder HTML file for now. You can check it out live:
